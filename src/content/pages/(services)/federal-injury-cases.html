            </p>
        
            <h2>Comprehensive Federal Employee Injury Representation</h2>
            <p>
                When federal employees suffer workplace injuries, navigating the complex web of federal regulations, compensation systems, and legal requirements can feel overwhelming. Our dedicated legal team specializes exclusively in federal injury cases, bringing years of focused experience to protect your rights and secure your future.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand that federal workplace injuries involve unique legal frameworks that differ significantly from standard workers' compensation cases. From initial claim filing through appeals and litigation, we guide federal employees through the <strong>Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA)</strong>, Defense Base Act (DBA) claims, Federal Tort Claims Act cases, and specialized federal compensation programs.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Our Federal Injury Cases Services</h2>
        
            <h3>FECA Claims and Appeals</h3>
            <p>
                The Federal Employees' Compensation Act provides crucial protections for injured federal workers, but claim denials and delays are unfortunately common. We handle initial FECA claims, medical treatment authorizations, wage loss compensation, and complex appeals processes. Our team works directly with the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) to ensure proper documentation and timely claim resolution.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Defense Base Act Claims</h3>
            <p>
                Federal contractors and employees working overseas face unique risks and compensation challenges. We represent clients in Defense Base Act cases, including overseas contractor injuries, military support personnel incidents, and international workplace accidents. Our expertise extends to coordinating with insurance carriers and navigating international legal complexities.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Federal Tort Claims Act Cases</h3>
            <p>
                When federal agency negligence causes injury, the Federal Tort Claims Act provides a pathway for compensation. We handle cases involving government facility accidents, agency misconduct, and federal employee negligence claims. These complex cases require deep understanding of sovereign immunity exceptions and federal liability standards.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Longshore Harbor Workers' Compensation</h3>
            <p>
                Maritime federal employees and contractors have specialized protection under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. We represent dock workers, maritime contractors, and harbor facility employees in injury claims, ensuring proper medical treatment and wage replacement benefits.
            </p>
        
            <h3>ICE False Arrest and Federal Detention Claims</h3>
            <p>
                Federal law enforcement actions that result in wrongful detention or false arrest require specialized legal expertise. We represent individuals harmed by improper ICE enforcement actions, unlawful detentions, and federal agency overreach, seeking compensation for damages and civil rights violations.
            </p>

            <h2>Understanding Your Federal Injury Rights</h2>
            <p>
                Federal employees have specific rights and protections that differ from private sector workers. You have the right to choose your own medical treatment providers, receive wage loss compensation during recovery, and appeal denied claims through established federal procedures. Understanding these rights is crucial for protecting your interests and securing appropriate compensation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Time limits in federal injury cases are strict and unforgiving. Missing deadlines can permanently bar your claim, making prompt legal action essential. Our team ensures all paperwork is filed correctly and on time, protecting your right to compensation.
            </p>
