## Trump Administration Ends Biden-Era Parole Programs

The Trump administration is set to terminate temporary legal status for more than 530,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who entered the U.S. during the Biden-era parole program. According to a Federal Register document, the program will end on April 24, 2025, requiring affected migrants to leave the U.S. before their parole termination date.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the action is in line with Trump's order to terminate parole programs that are incompatible with U.S. immigration laws. DHS will remove those who overstay unless they have obtained legal immigration status.

These parole programs, which permit migrants to remain for a maximum of two years with work authorization, were launched by the Biden administration in 2022. Later, the policy was extended to cover up to 30,000 individuals per month; however, it was not renewed the previous year.
