## Termination of TPS for Venezuelans

The termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans as announced by the DHS is an order that will significantly affect over 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the United States.

The National TPS Alliance presented a lawsuit against the Secretary of Homeland Security Noem, clarifying that the action of terminating the order is illegal, and the DHS has no authority to terminate a prior TPS extension.

However, the order currently remains in effect, with specific details on the duration of status. Venezuelans who received TPS in 2021 are allowed to stay in the U.S legally until September 2025, while those who were granted TPS in 2023 will be able to remain in the country until April 2025.
