        "I have to say this experience has been the most stress free endeavour I have encountered. Taking into acount that this was a major decision and change in our lives. From the very start David took the time to listen and understand our needs. Then layed out a path best suited to what we needed. Once we were clear we were guided step by step and with each step we were kept in the loop of progress and upcoming requirements. At anytime that we had queries they were answered and clarified. Always professional and proficient in our communications. I want to say Thank you Focil Legal, you and your team are amazing.

        A special thanks to Sebastian with whom I had many interactions and was always ready to help and guide us through the document requirements. Sebastian, your professionalism and knowledge in all aspects of the process were welcomed."
